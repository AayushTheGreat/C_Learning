This repository contains the C programs I wrote while learning C programming.
Itâ€™s a personal collection of practice codes, starting from basics and gradually moving towards data structures and algorithms.

ðŸ“Œ Contents

ðŸ”¹ Basics

Functions & recursion

Arrays, strings, and pointers

ðŸ”¹ Data Structures (so far)

Stack (array & linked list)

Queue (linear & circular, array & linked list)

Linked List

Singly linked list

Doubly linked list

ðŸ”¹ Work in Progress / Future Plans

Iâ€™ll keep adding more programs as I learn, including:

Circular linked list

Priority queue & Deque

Trees (binary tree, BST, AVL)

Graphs (BFS, DFS)

Sorting & searching algorithms

ðŸ’» How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-learning.git
cd c-learning


Compile and run any program using:

gcc filename.c -o output
./output

ðŸ“– Note

This repo is not meant to teach but rather to document my own learning journey in C programming.
Feel free to explore the code if youâ€™re curious!
